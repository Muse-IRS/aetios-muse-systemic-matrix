## 1. Scope of This Document

This document clarifies the licensing and usage context of the
**Aétios Muse Systemic Matrix (AMSM)** repository and its core component,
the **Silence-First Framework (SSF)**.

It does **not** replace, override, or modify the Apache License 2.0.
It is provided as an **informational notice** describing:

- governance intent,
- recommended usage pathways,
- optional commercial and compliance programs.

---

## 2. Open Source License (Default)

All source code in this repository is released under:

**Apache License, Version 2.0**

You are free to:

- use,
- modify,
- distribute,
- embed,
- fork

the code, in accordance with the Apache 2.0 license terms.

This includes (non-exhaustive):

- academic research,
- experimentation,
- benchmarking,
- non-commercial deployments,
- commercial deployments,
- internal evaluation.

The Apache 2.0 license applies **as-is**.

---

## 3. Research and Academic Use

The following uses are explicitly encouraged:

- academic research and publications,
- preprints (arXiv, HAL, etc.),
- reproducible experiments,
- teaching and educational material,
- open benchmarking and comparative studies.

No additional permission is required for these uses.

Citation is requested via the provided `CITATION.cff` file.

---

## 4. Commercial and Industrial Use (Clarification)

Apache 2.0 already allows commercial use.

However, SSF is a **systemic control layer**.
In safety-critical or regulated contexts, organizations commonly require:

- documented assumptions,
- audit trails,
- validation protocols,
- compliance reporting,
- certification evidence,
- long-term maintenance guarantees.

This repository provides an open reference implementation.
It does not claim to provide sector-specific certification or compliance
out of the box.

---

## 5. Optional Commercial Programs (Non-Restrictive)

Independent of the Apache 2.0 license rights, maintainers may offer
(optional, non-mandatory) commercial programs such as:

- compliance support and audit documentation,
- certification-oriented builds,
- hardened industrial versions,
- sector-specific adaptations (finance, aviation, energy, defense, government),
- SLA, support, and long-term maintenance.

These programs are **optional** and do not restrict Apache 2.0 usage.

---

## 6. Dual Track Strategy (Planned)

Aétios Muse Systemic Matrix follows a dual-track strategy:

### 6.1 Open Source Track
- Apache License 2.0
- Community-driven
- Research, experimentation, evaluation
- Reference kernel and reproducible benchmarks

### 6.2 Industrial Track (Optional)
- Hardened distributions
- Compliance tooling
- Certification support
- Sector-specific integration layers
- Long-term maintenance

The industrial track may later be operated by a formal legal entity
once registered.

---

## 7. No Warranty / No Liability

Unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing:

- The software is provided **“AS IS”**.
- No warranty is provided, express or implied.
- The authors and contributors assume no liability
  for damages resulting from the use of this software.

This clause mirrors the Apache 2.0 license.

---

## 8. Governance and Future Evolution

This repository represents a **reference implementation** of SSF.

Future evolutions may include:

- certified builds,
- hardened industrial versions,
- sector-specific branches,
- formal verification layers,
- reproducible benchmark suites.

Such evolutions do not retroactively alter
the license of existing open source code.

---

## 9. Canonical Repository and Academic Reference

To reduce ambiguity across forks, this repository is considered the
**canonical public reference** for SSF under the AMSM label.

Academic citations should reference:

- the repository URL,
- the release tag (version),
- and `CITATION.cff`.

Forks remain valid under Apache 2.0.
This section is informational and does not restrict forking.

---

## 10. Contact

For:

- industrial partnerships,
- compliance programs,
- certification pathways,
- long-term maintenance discussions,

contact will be provided through official channels
once a formal legal structure is registered.

Until then, contact is available via the public GitHub repository.

---

## 11. Summary (Non-Legal)

- SSF is open source under Apache 2.0.
- Commercial use is permitted under Apache 2.0.
- Research use is free and encouraged.
- Optional industrial programs may exist in the future.
- Silence is a right — also in governance.
