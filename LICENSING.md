## 1. Scope of This Document

This document clarifies the licensing and usage conditions of the
**Aétios Muse Systemic Matrix (AMSM)** repository and its core component,
the **Silence-First Framework (SSF)**.

It does **not** replace the Apache License 2.0.
It complements it by describing **governance, usage intent, and commercial pathways**.

---

## 2. Open Source License (Default)

All source code in this repository is released under:

**Apache License, Version 2.0**

You are free to:
- use,
- modify,
- distribute,
- embed,
- fork

the code, in accordance with the Apache 2.0 license terms.

This includes:
- academic research,
- experimentation,
- benchmarking,
- non-commercial deployments,
- internal evaluation.

The Apache 2.0 license applies **as-is**.

---

## 3. Research and Academic Use

The following uses are explicitly encouraged and supported:

- academic research and publications,
- preprints (arXiv, HAL, etc.),
- reproducible experiments,
- teaching and educational material,
- open benchmarking and comparative studies.

No additional permission is required for these uses.

Citation is requested via the provided `CITATION.cff` file.

## 4. Commercial and Industrial Use Notice

While the code is open source under Apache 2.0,
**commercial or industrial deployment of SSF as a systemic control layer**
may require a **separate commercial license and compliance agreement**.

This applies in particular to uses involving:

- large-scale production systems,
- safety-critical environments (finance, aviation, energy, defense, government),
- regulated infrastructures,
- high-cost inference pipelines,
- sovereign or mission-critical AI systems.

This notice does **not** restrict Apache 2.0 rights,
but signals the existence of an **optional commercial governance framework**.

---

## 5. Dual Licensing Model (Planned)

Aétios Muse Systemic Matrix follows a **dual licensing strategy**:

### 5.1 Open Source Track
- Apache License 2.0
- Community-driven
- Research, experimentation, evaluation

### 5.2 Commercial Track (Optional)
- Commercial license agreement
- Compliance, audit, and certification
- SLA, support, and long-term maintenance
- Sector-specific adaptations (finance, aviation, government, etc.)

The commercial track will be operated by the legal entity
**Aétios Muse Systemic Matrix (AMSM)** once formally established.

---

## 6. No Warranty / No Liability

Unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing:

- The software is provided **“AS IS”**.
- No warranty is provided, express or implied.
- The authors and contributors assume no liability
  for damages resulting from the use of this software.

This clause mirrors the Apache 2.0 license.

---

## 7. Governance and Future Evolution

This repository represents the **reference implementation** of SSF.

Future evolutions may include:
- certified builds,
- hardened industrial versions,
- sector-specific branches,
- formal verification layers.

Such evolutions do not retroactively alter
the license of existing open source code.

---

## 8. Contact

For:
- commercial licensing,
- compliance questions,
- industrial partnerships,
- certification programs,

contact will be provided through official AMSM channels
once the legal entity is registered.

---

## 9. Summary (Non-Legal)

- SSF is open source.
- Research use is free and encouraged.
- Commercial deployment may require a separate agreement.
- Silence is a right — also in licensing.
