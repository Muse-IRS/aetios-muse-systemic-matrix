## 1. Scope

This document explains how licensing is handled in this repository.

It does **not** replace the Apache License 2.0.
It does **not** add restrictions.
It provides **clarity**.

---

## 2. License (Binding)

All source code in this repository is released under:

**Apache License, Version 2.0**

Apache 2.0 applies **as-is**.

This includes, without limitation:
- academic research,
- non-commercial deployments,
- **commercial deployments**,
- industrial production systems,
- forks and redistribution.

---

## 3. Warranty / Liability

The software is provided **"AS IS"**.

No warranty is provided, express or implied.
No liability is assumed.

This is not a separate clause.
It is the Apache 2.0 position.

---

## 4. Canonical Reference

This repository is the **reference implementation** of SSF.

Forks are normal in open source.
However, the SSF reference kernel is defined by:

- the code in this repository,
- the preprint in `paper/`,
- the invariant definition:
  L = (Φ_c · π) / Ω

Derivative implementations remain free under Apache 2.0,
but should not be presented as the reference kernel
if their behavior diverges.

---

## 5. Commercial Pathway (Non-Legal)

Apache 2.0 already allows commercial use.

The purpose of a future commercial entity (if established)
is not to restrict usage,
but to provide optional services such as:

- deployment engineering,
- industrial hardening,
- audit methodology,
- certification and reporting,
- long-term maintenance,
- sector-specific adaptations.

This is a service pathway, not a license barrier.

---

## 6. Contact

No official commercial contact exists at this time.
This repository is published as an open research initiative.

---

## 7. Summary

- SSF is open source under Apache 2.0.
- Commercial use is permitted.
- Forks are expected.
- The reference implementation is this repository.
