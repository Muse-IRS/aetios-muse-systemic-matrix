# Code of Conduct

Aétios Muse Systemic Matrix (AMSM) — Open Research Initiative

This repository exists to build and preserve a minimal, auditable SSF reference.

By participating, you agree to:

- be respectful,
- be precise,
- argue ideas, not people,
- avoid harassment, intimidation, or personal attacks,
- avoid spam, noise, and bad-faith disruption.

This is not a social space.
This is a technical research repository.

If you cannot engage calmly and rigorously, do not engage.

Maintainers may moderate, lock, or remove content when necessary.
