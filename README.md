# Aétios Muse Systemic Matrix

**A causal regulation framework for sovereign, resilient, and finite AI systems.**

---

## Overview

**Aétios Muse Systemic Matrix** introduces **SSF (Silence–Structure–Filter)**,  
a **pre-inference causal regulator** designed to decide **when an AI system is allowed to act**,  
not *what* it should say.

SSF operates **upstream of reasoning**, acting as a **causal gate** that protects AI systems from:

- saturation,
- runaway computation,
- adversarial prompt flooding,
- decoherence-like instability (classical or quantum),
- uncontrolled cost escalation.

It formalizes **silence as a valid, measurable, and bounded system state**.

---

## Core Principle

The system relies on a single invariant:

\[
L = (\Phi_c \cdot \pi) / \Omega
\]

Where:
- **Φ** is a multi-channel causal phase (information, thermodynamics, time, noise),
- **Φ_c** is its inertially filtered form,
- **Ω** is a reference frequency,
- **L** is a universal causal load invariant.

**L allows heterogeneous domains to be compared on a single axis.**

## What SSF Is

- A **causal regulator**
- A **pre-inference gate**
- A **systemic protection layer**
- A **silence governance mechanism**

---

## What SSF Is Not

SSF is **not**:
- a content filter,
- a classifier,
- a moral or ethical judge,
- a reasoning engine,
- an alignment policy.

SSF decides **if** an AI may think — not **how** it thinks.

---

## Use Cases

- Large-scale conversational AI (ChatGPT-like systems)
- High-cost inference pipelines
- Safety-critical automation
- Financial and industrial control systems
- Hybrid classical / quantum workloads
- Research on computational saturation and limits

---

## Architecture Positioning

SSF is designed to sit **before**:
- LLM inference,
- tool execution,
- quantum circuit execution,
- costly optimization loops.

It is compatible with:
- OpenAI-style architectures,
- Anthropic-style constitutional layers,
- Google-scale distributed systems.

## Open Source Policy

This repository provides:
- the **reference SSF kernel**,
- the **causal invariant definition**,
- reproducible simulations and benchmarks.

The code is released under **Apache License 2.0**.

### Commercial Use Notice

While Aétios Muse Systemic Matrix (AMSM) is open source under the Apache License 2.0,  
commercial or industrial deployment of the Silence-First Framework (SSF) may require  
a separate commercial license and compliance agreement.

See `LICENSING.md` for details.

## Documentation

- 📘 Whitepaper (conceptual & strategic): `docs/whitepaper.md`
- 📄 Academic preprint (LaTeX, arXiv/HAL-ready): `paper/ssf_preprint.tex`

The two documents are complementary:
- the whitepaper explains *why* SSF exists,
- the preprint formalizes *how* it works.

## Status

**Experimental / Production-ready core**  
Safe for:
- academic research,
- industrial proof-of-concept,
- benchmarking and evaluation.

## Academic Reference / Canonical Repository

This GitHub repository is the **canonical public reference** for the  
**Silence-First Framework (SSF)** within the **Aétios Muse Systemic Matrix (AMSM)** initiative.

For academic reproducibility and attribution:
- the **arXiv/HAL-ready preprint** is located in `paper/`,
- the **reference implementation** is located in `src/`,
- citation metadata is provided in `CITATION.cff`.

Forks and derivative implementations are expected in open source, but this repository should be treated as the **primary reference source** for SSF.
