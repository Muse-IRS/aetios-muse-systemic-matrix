# Licensing Model — Aétios Muse Systemic Matrix

The Aétios Muse Systemic Matrix (AMSM) project is distributed under a
**dual-licensing model**.

## Open Source License

The reference implementation of the Silence-First Framework (SSF)
is released under the **Apache License 2.0**.

This license grants permission to:
- use, study, modify, and redistribute the software,
- for research, evaluation, benchmarking, and experimental purposes.

## Commercial and Industrial Use

Use of SSF in **production systems**, **commercial products**, or
**regulated environments** (including but not limited to finance,
aviation, defense, energy, healthcare, or government systems)
**may require a separate commercial license**.

Such use includes:
- SaaS or API deployment,
- integration into proprietary platforms,
- safety-critical or mission-critical systems,
- large-scale inference cost optimization.

## Commercial Licensing

A commercial license provides:
- contractual authorization for production use,
- audit and compliance framework,
- sector-specific adaptations,
- governance and liability clarification.

For commercial licensing inquiries:
contact: licensing@aetios-muse-systemic-matrix.org

## Rationale

SSF is a causal regulation layer that governs *when* a system may act.
Uncontrolled deployment in critical systems may create systemic risks.
This licensing model ensures responsible industrial adoption.
